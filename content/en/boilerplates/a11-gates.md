<sup>1</sup> These restrictions only apply to aircraft arriving at an airport within A11 and _not_ filed on an arrival that supports "Descend Via" restrictions. Aircraft arriving on a STAR with published
crossing restrictions shall be assigned "Descend Via" by ZAN.
<sup>2</sup> During ELLAM/WITTI arrivals (ANC landing 15), YESKA and SEWAR combine into a single departure-only gate.

When A11 implements `light traffic procedures`, sector 5 and 6 may negate arrival gate and altitude restrictions. Sector 7 may negate altitude restrictions. `Light traffic procedures` is assumed
to be in effect at all times outside of events unless otherwise coordinated.

Aircraft arriving ENA may exit Kenai gate at 2000, 4000, or 6000. SXQ 4000 or 6000 (any gate).
