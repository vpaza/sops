# Anchorage TRACON (A11)

## General Information

{{< metar "PANC" "ANC METAR" >}}

{{< taf "PANC" "ANC TAF" >}}

{{< metar "PAED" "EDF METAR" >}}

{{< metar "PAMR" "MRI METAR" >}}

## Positions

{{< tracon-positions "A11" >}}

The primary position is `A11 NR` and that position shall be opened before any others.

## Common Procedures

1. Upon communications transfer to `FR` from any other A11 positions, FR shall have control for turns and descents
2. All sectors must QuickLook all other A11 sectors
3. Sector boundaries are dependent upon and change with ANC's primary arrival runways
4. Where FR combines when not opened, but `NR` and `SR` shall be coordinated between the two controllers

## North Radar

1. Runway 7L/7R (to FR):
   1. Unless on an RNAV Procedure, aircraft should be at 4000 on downwind, and when west of Fire Island turned to a left base and descended to 3000
   2. KROTO RNAV aircraft should descend via the arrival
2. Runway 15 (to FR):
   1. Right traffic assigned 5000 or descending on an RNAV arrival
   2. Left traffic assigned 6000 on left base or downwind, or on an RNAV arrival
3. Runway 25L/25R (to SR):
   1. Routed over or west of Fire Island and assigned 5000
4. MRI traffic:
   1. IFR aircraft conducting a visual approach or VFR from the west/northwest should be vectored parallel the Runway 15 final approach course toward the Mouth of Ship Creek before being switched to MRI
   2. IFR aircraft conducting the RNAV must first be pointed out with ANC LC prior to receiving approach clearance. Extreme caution should be used due to this approach course crossing Runway 15's approach course, Runway 33's Departure corridor, and it's proximity to the EDF final approach course
   3. VFR aircraft from the east side of the Class D's should be instructed to remain east of Glenn Highway and once they have MRI in-sight, switched to MRI LC

## South Radar

1. Runway 7L/7R (to FR):
   1. Unless on an RNAV Procedure, aircraft should be at 5000 downwind. Base over or east of TULLI descending to 3000 or west of TULLI descending to 4000
2. Runway 15 (to NR):
   1. Assigned 5000 and vectored downwind
3. Runway 25L/R (to FR):
   1. Vectored for left traffic
4. Runway 33 (to FR):
   1. Assigned 5000 and vectored downwind
5. MRI traffic:
   1. IFR aircraft conducting a visual approach and VFR aircraft should be instructed to remain east of Campbell Airstrip, and once they have MRI in-sight, switched to MRI LC
   2. IFR aircraft unable to conduct a visual approach should be vectored over Fire Island at 2000 and switched to NR.

## Final Radar

1. Handoff to tower upon issuance of approach clearance, or for VFR aircraft, no later than 10 miles from the airport
2. Transfer communications no later than 7 nautical miles
3. May coordinate missed approach instructions with LC:
   1. Runway 7L/7R/15: Leaving 600, turn right heading 200. Climb and maintain 2500.
   2. Runway 25L/25R: Fly heading 250, climb and maintain 2500.
   3. Runway 33: Leaving 600, turn left heading 300. Climb and maintain 2500.
