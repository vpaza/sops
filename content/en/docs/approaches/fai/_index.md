## Common Procedures

1. Applies TRSA separation between participating aircraft and all other aircraft in the airspace. This includes if one aircraft is participating and another is not
2. Aircraft departing the airspace southbound shall utilize the Nenana Gate (see [Appendix A](docs/approaches/fai/#appendix-a-erwr-boundary)) unless on a departure procedure or otherwise coordinated with ZAN. This gate is defined as west of the Chena
   NDB on a southbound course while also on their filed route or direct to the next point of their filed route. This deconflicts with arrivals from the south into FAI.
