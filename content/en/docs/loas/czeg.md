# VATUSA ANCHORAGE ARTCC AND VATCAN EDMONTON FIR LETTER OF AGREEMENT

Effective: January 26, 2023

1. **PURPOSE** This agreement establishes coordination procedures and defines delegation of airspace between Anchorage ARTCC (PAZA) and Edmonton FIR (CZEG). This agreement is supplemental to the FAA JO 7110.65 and the NavCanada Air Traffic MANOPS/MATS, and other network policies. Where conflicts exist, those documents shall supersede this agreement.
2. **DISCLAIMER** Information contained herein is designed and specifically for use in a virtual Air Traffic Control environment. It is in no way applicable to nor should be used in real world aviation environments.
3. **RESPONSIBILITIES** As defined by aeronautical chart or approved, government issued, or endorsed aeronautical publication/document; unless coordinated by written or verbal methods, facilities listed with a controlling agency will be controlled by said agency regardless of location relative to ARTCC/FIR outlined boundaries. Required coordination must be completed and approved prior to aircraft entering/exiting said airspace.
4. **CANCELLATION** This document cancels any previous agreements between CZEG and PAZA.
5. **SHARED PROCEDURES**
   1. Each ARTCC/FIR shall route and restrict aircraft in accordance with Attachment A.
   2. Follow the Common Boundaries as established in Attachment B.
   3. Handoffs shall be conducted using automation to exchange radar identification to the extent possible.
      1. Handoffs must be conducted no later than 10 minutes prior to the common boundary. Any changes after handoff has been initiated must be coordinated prior to issuing to aircraft (route, altitude, squawk, etc).
      2. Transfer of control shall occur only at the common boundary unless otherwise coordinated, but the transferring controller may, upon transfer of communications: conduct turns of 20 degrees or less, or reassign beacon codes.
      3. Any abnormal flight conditions, for example incorrect altitude for direction of flight, must be coordinated and emphasized to the receiving controller.
      4. Flights originating within 5 minutes of the boundary that will cross that boundary, must be coordinated with the receiving controller prior to or as soon as possible after departure.
      5. Transfer of communications must occur prior to the aircraft crossing the common boundary.
      6. The transferring controller shall ensure that no less than 10 nautical mile in-trail spacing exists for aircraft on the same routing at the same altitude.
      7. Handoffs to PAZA controllers shall be to the designated areas or sectors as documented in Attachment C.
      8. Handoffs to CZEG controllers shall be to the designated positions as documented in Attachment D.

## Attachment C - PAZA Enroute Sectorization

The following figure is the visual representation of the eastern boundary of the PAZA airspace.

{{< image link="./paza-czeg-east.png" width="80%" caption="PAZA Eastern Boundary" >}}

1. Areas
   1. North Area (Red):
      1. Combines to Sector 15 (ANC_15_CTR)
      2. When ANC_15_CTR is not staffed, the area will combine to Sector 6 (ANC_06_CTR)
   2. Central Area (Blue):
      1. All handoffs go to Sector 7 (ANC_07_CTR)
      2. When ANC_07_CTR is not staffed, the area will combine to Sector 6 (ANC_06_CTR)
   3. South Area (Yellow):
      1. All handoffs go to Sector 8 (ANC_08_CTR)
      2. When ANC_08_CTR is not staffed, the area will combine to Sector 6 (ANC_06_CTR)
   4. Arctic (uncolored):
      1. All aircraft entering PAZA airspace north of N072.00.00.000 W141.00.00.000 are not controlled by a domestic sector. The controller for this airspace is **ONLY** ZAN_64_FSS on VHF 134.4 or HF 17.925.
   5. When the above is not followed, PAZA controllers shall coordinate the area designations to all neighboring controllers. Outside of events, individual sectors are not staffed... only areas. Areas are defined in the table below.
2. Sector designations (green numbers in above) for purposes of illustrating splits on video maps:
   1. Point 1 and 2 (Boundary between 4 and 15):
      1. N067.20.00.000 W141.00.00.000 N066.07.00.000 W154.00.00.000
   2. Point 3 and 4 (Boundary between 15 and 16):
      1. N066.40.00.000 W141.00.00.000 N066.40.00.000 W144.30.00.000
   3. Point 5 and 6 (Boundary between North Area and Central Area [and sectors 16 and 7]):
      1. N063.20.00.000 W141.00.00.000 N062.50.00.000 W146.35.00.000
   4. Point 7 and 8 (Boundary between Central Area and South Area [and sectors 7 and 8]):
      1. N060.21.00.000 W139.11.00.000 N060.32.00.000 W141.20.00.000

| Area Name | Primary Sector Callsign | Radio Callsign | Frequency (VHF) |
| --------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| North (Red) | ANC_15_CTR | Anchorage Center | 120.9 |
| Central (Blue)&#42; | ANC_07_CTR | Anchorage Center | 132.3 |
| South (Yellow) | ANC_08_CTR | Anchorage Center | 126.1 |

## Attachment D - CZEG Enroute Coordination

The following diagram is a visual representation of the western shared border of CZEG and PAZA:

{{< image link="./czeg-western.png" width="50%" caption="CZEG Western Border" >}}

1. Area handoffs go to CZEG_N_CTR (Edmonton Centre), CZEG_CTR (if CZEG_N_CTR is not staffed) or *CZEG_FSS (Edmonton Centre) if CZEG_N_CTR and CZEG_CTR are not staffed.

| Area | Primary Sector calslign | Radio Callsign | Frequency |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Common Border | CZEG_N_CTR | Edmonton Centre | 134.675 |

| Common Border | &#42;*CZEG_FSS | Edmonton Centre | 135.025 |

&#42; **CZEG_FSS** (Edmonton Centre) is the primary staffed position
