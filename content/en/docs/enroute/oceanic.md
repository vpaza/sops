#### Radar Coverage

The Pacific area does have radar coverage for a portion closest to the Domestic side. This may be used to provide radar services, especially for departures and arrivals, and establishing
radar identification.

This radar coverage is viewable by enabling the `Sys > SRM` map in vatSys.

procedures.
