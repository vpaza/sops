## Common Procedures

This facilities are rarely staffed so they will not have very detailed procedures.

## Ground Control

1. Initial Altitudes for IFR aircraft shall be requested from the overlying radar controller.
2. IFR departures from FBK shall be assigned an initial heading of 180. For example: "Cleared to (destination), as filed. On departure fly heading 180."

## Local Control

1. All IFR aircraft require a release from the overlying radar controller unless otherwise coordinated.

### Runway selection guidance

Runways will be selected based on current and forecasted weather conditions as well as any neighboring controlled facility runway selections. Civilian airport runway
selections will take precedence over military field runway selections and care should be taken to mirror as closely as possible.
