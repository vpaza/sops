## General Notes

A Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA) has been established for the separation
and sequencing of all VFR aircraft participating in TRSA services. Basic radar
services have been established to provide sequencing and advisories on a
full-time basis to aircraft desiring basic radar services and declining TRSA
services. Wake turbulence application for TRSA and Basic Radar service aircraft
is the responsibility of the Radar Controller as per FAAO 7110.65 7-6-7 c.1, 2 and
7-7-3 and must continue to the ground.

## Clearance Delivery

1. IFR Aircraft
   1. Initial altitude is 10,000 feet or filed altitude, whichever is lower except when departing:
      1. Runway 2L/2R: AOA 5,000 feet
      2. Runway 20L/20R: AOA 3,000 feet
      3. Aircraft conducting practice approaches to FAI shall be assigned no lower than 5,000 feet
   2. All aircraft shall be assigned either:
      1. Standard Instrument Departure Procedure
      2. A departure heading
         1. Runway 2L/2R: 035
         2. Runway 20L/20R: Runway Heading
2. VFR Aircraft
   1. Aircraft that have not stated they do not wish to have TRSA services shall be assumed to be requesting them.
   2. Departure instructions for VFR Aircraft:
      1. TRSA Services: "N12345, Fairbanks Clearance, TRSA departure which is fly runway heading until further advised, departure frequency 125.35, squawk 1234"
      2. No TRSA, but flight following: assign departure frequency and squawk
3. Aircraft departing within FAI Class D, but not from FAI, shall be instructed to remain on the ground and contact FAI LC for departure instructions. IFR operations
   from those fields are not authorized.

## Ground Control

1. Ensure all aircraft have spoken to Clearance Delivery unless they are VFR and not requesting TRSA or flight following.
  
## Local Control

1. VFR aircraft that will transition FBK airspace shall be coordinated prior to departure
2. Aircraft departing Chena Marina, Metro Field or other locations within the FAI Class D airport that are not FAI shall receive departure instructions to deconflict with FAI
   traffic prior to departure
3. VFR aircraft receiving TRSA services may be turned "on course" at the controller's discretion provided prior coordination with the departure controller
4. All aircraft are assumed release for departure **except** Red Flag and Drill departure procedures, and unless otherwise coordinated
5. Missed approach procedures shall be instructed to climb on the standard IFR heading (runway 2L/2R: 035, runway 20L/20R: runway heading) with a climb to 5000 before switching back to
   the approach controller unless otherwise requested and coordinated

### Runway selection guidance

Primary runways are based on forecasted wind, neighboring traffic flows and other weather conditions.

1. Runway 2L/2R are the primary runways for arrivals and departures
2. Runway 20L/20R are the secondary runways for arrivals and departures if there is a forecasted tailwind component at or above 10 knots

### Primary Diverse Vector Area

Primary Diverse Vector Area defines departure headings for IFR departures may be issued for operational efficiency as listed. These headings must be coordinated with,
but not need approval from, the appropriate departure controller. LC should take care to ensure there is no conflicting traffic by utilizing the Tower Display Workstation (TDW).

1. Runway 2L/2R: 057 clockwise to 200
   1. **NOTE** Runway 2L departures require a climb rate of 210 feet per nautical mile to 1,600 feet
2. Runway 20L/20R: 198 counter-clockwise to 023
